## Development

## Pre-requisites

We use docker for development. So you need to install docker and docker-compose in your machine.
After installing docker and docker-compose, you need to run the following command to start all services.

```bash
bash scripts/start.sh # start all services
bash scripts/stop.sh # stop all services
```

## Deployment on Vercel ðŸš€

### Git Setup in Vercel

We have to ignore build step in Vercel in terms of deployment. So we have to setup git in vercel.

`Settings` -> `Git` -> `Ignored Build Step`  and add the following command.

```sh
git diff HEAD^ HEAD --quiet ./
```

# Run SuperVisor

```sh
brew services start supervisor
```

# Laravel with MongoDB in Mac

## Install MongoDB

```sh
brew install icu4c #install unicode library
brew link icu4c --force
```

## Install PHP MongoDB Driver

```sh
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"

sudo pecl install mongodb
```

## Add extension to php.ini

Add the following lines to your php.ini file

```ini
extension = rdkafka.so
extension = mongodb.so
```
