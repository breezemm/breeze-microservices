# Setting up the environment

In this section, we will set up the environment for the project. We will install the necessary tools and libraries to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Windows, Linux)
- [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) (Yet another container runtime for macOS)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [bun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bun) (Package manager for Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) (or any other code editor)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

P.S.If you are using Windows, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install Docker.

## Clone the project

First, let's clone the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myanmarcyberyouths/breeze
```

## Start the environment

You can start the environment by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

You can use the `--build` flag to rebuild the images like this after introducing changes to the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Using `make` for the sake of simplicity

We have a `Makefile` in the project root directory to simplify the process of running commands.
You can use the `make` command to run the commands in the `Makefile`.
For example, you can enter to the `gateway` container by running the following command:

```bash
make gateway
```

<Note>
  For the other commands, you can check the `Makefile` in the project root directory. Make sure to run the commands in
  the root directory of the project.
</Note>
