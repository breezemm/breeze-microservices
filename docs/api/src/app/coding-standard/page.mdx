# Standards

This guide will help you to write a good code and to follow the best practices in our organization. It will help you to understand the code and to maintain it.

## General

- Always use the **defined stable version** of the language or framework.
- Follow up the **best practices** and **standards** of the language or framework.
- Always use **version control** for your code.
- Always use **code review** for your code.
- Always use **unit tests** for your code.
- Always use **conventional commit** for your commit messages.

## Naming
Naming is one of the most important things in programming. It should be clear and meaningful. It should be easy to understand and to read. You must avoid using abbreviations and single letters.
You are not allowed to use the following names:
- Single letters
- Abbreviations
- Numbers
- Special characters
- Reserved words

We can sometimes use abbreviations if they are well known and widely used. For example, we can use `id` instead of `identifier`. And `df` instead of `dataframe` in Machine Learning.
I would like to mention that you should use the same naming convention for all the files and folders in your project.
You should also avoid writing comments in the code to explain the meaning of the names. The names should be clear and meaningful.


## Comments
Comments are very important in the code. They help to understand the code and to maintain it. You should write comments for the following cases:
- To explain the code
- To explain the logic
- To explain the algorithm
- To explain the function
- To explain the class
- To explain the variable (if it is not clear)
- To explain the constant
- To explain the configuration

You should avoid writing comments for the following cases:
- To explain the obvious
- To explain the code that is clear
- To explain the code that is easy to understand
- To explain the code that is well written

You should also avoid writing comments in the code to explain the meaning of the names. The names should be clear and meaningful.

## Formatting

Formatting is very important in the code. It helps to read and understand the code. It helps to maintain the code. You should follow the best practices and standards of the language or framework. You should also use the same formatting for all the files and folders in your project.
We are using `prettier` for formatting the code. You should use the same configuration for all the files and folders in your project.

## Functions

In our code base, we are using the following rules for the functions:
- The function should do only one thing.
- The function should be small.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful name.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful signature.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful documentation.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful comments.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful error handling.
- The function should have a clear and meaningful testing.

## Classes

In our PHP code base, especially in the Laravel framework, we are using the following rules for the classes:
- The class should have a clear and meaningful name.
- The class should have a clear and meaningful signature.
- The class should have a clear and meaningful documentation.
- The class should have a clear and meaningful comments.
- The class should have a clear and meaningful error handling.

## Imports
We are using the following rules for the imports:
- Optimize the imports
- Use the same formatting for all the files and folders in your project.
- Use the same formatting for all the imports in your project.

## Error Handling
Error handling is very important in the code. It helps to understand the code and to maintain it. You should follow the best practices and standards of the language or framework. You should also use the same error handling for all the files and folders in your project.
- Use `try` and `catch` for the error handling.
- Use `throw` for the error handling.
- Use `finally` for the error handling.
- Early return for the error handling.
- Use the same error handling for all the files and folders in your project.

## Testing

We currently only have `API` testing. I would like to document rules later for the testing.

## Security

Security is very important in the code. You should follow the best practices and standards of the language or framework. You should also use the same security for all the files and folders in your project.
If you found any CVEs in the dependencies, you should fix them as soon as possible and report to the security team immediately.

## Performance

Performance is very important in the code. You should follow the best practices and standards of the language or framework. You should also use the same performance for all the files and folders in your project.
- API must respond within 100ms which is `0.1s` in general. If it is not possible, you should optimize the code and the database queries.
- We will use `Lighthouse` for the performance testing for the web applications especially for the React and Next.js applications.
