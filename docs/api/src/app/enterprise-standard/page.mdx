## Coding Standard

<Note>
  For the coding standard, you can refer to the [Coding Standard](/coding-standards) guide in our documentation.
</Note>

## Version Control System

We use git and GitHub to manage our code. Our codebase is hosted on the GitHub Server. I would like to encourage you to use
the official GitHub CLI (gh) so that you can create pull requests from the CLI without needing to navigate the GitHub user interface. We are working on centralizing our platform with the CLI, as we know we are software engineers.


## Project Management System

As a new developer or intern developer, you'll be using Jira and Plane.so to manage and track your tasks in your projects effectively.
This guide will walk you through the basics of these platforms and provide an overview of the agile/scrum and waterfall methodologies we utilize.

### 1. Jira:

Jira is a powerful project management tool used for tracking issues, managing projects, and collaborating with team members.

**Key Features:**
- **Issue Tracking:** Create and track tasks, bugs, and features using customizable issue types.
- **Project Management:** Organize tasks into projects, assign them to team members, and set due dates.
- **Scrum and Kanban Boards:** Visualize work progress using agile boards, with options for scrum and kanban methodologies.
- **Custom Workflows:** Define custom workflows to reflect your team's unique process.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports to analyze project progress and team performance.

**Getting Started:**
- **Navigating Jira:** Familiarize yourself with the Jira interface, including the dashboard, projects, issues, and boards.
- **Creating Issues:** Learn how to create new issues, set priorities, assignees, and due dates.
- **Working with Boards:** Understand how to use scrum and kanban boards to manage work and track progress.

### 2. Plane.so:

Plane.so is a collaborative project management platform designed for remote teams. It offers features for task management, team communication, and file sharing.

**Key Features:**
- **Task Management:** Create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress.
- **Team Communication:** Collaborate with team members using built-in messaging and video conferencing.
- **File Sharing:** Share files and documents securely within the platform.
- **Time Tracking:** Log time spent on tasks for accurate project tracking.
- **Integrations:** Connect with other tools and platforms to streamline workflows.

**Getting Started:**
- **Creating Tasks:** Learn how to create new tasks, set priorities, and assign them to team members.
- **Communicating with Team:** Utilize messaging and video conferencing features to communicate effectively with your team.
- **File Sharing:** Share relevant files and documents related to your tasks.

### 3. Agile/Scrum and Waterfall Methodologies:

We employ both agile/scrum and waterfall methodologies depending on the project requirements.

- **Agile/Scrum:** Projects are divided into small, manageable tasks called user stories, which are organized into sprints. Daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives are key components of the agile/scrum framework.

- **Waterfall:** Projects progress through a linear sequence of phases, including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

**Tips for Success:**
- **Communication:** Regular communication with team members and stakeholders is essential for successful project management.
- **Organization:** Keep tasks and project documentation well-organized and up-to-date.
- **Adaptability:** Be flexible and open to adapting your approach based on project requirements and feedback.

By familiarizing yourself with Jira, Plane.so, and our project management methodologies, you'll be equipped to contribute effectively to our projects. Don't hesitate to reach out to your team members or mentors if you have any questions or need assistance. Welcome aboard, and let's build great things together!

## Continuous Integration System

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository.
This integration process is automated and includes building and testing the code to detect and fix integration errors early. Here's a general overview of our Continuous Integration system:

### Tools Used

- GitHub Actions
- Vercel CI Actions

### Vercel

For the vercel, we don't employ our own CI, we use the default CI of the Vercel so that we can reduce our operation overhead.
We deploy all of our frontends on the Vercel including
Micro-frontends, Micro-AI Serverless Backend APIs and Laravel Applications.
