# Architecture

We use Domain Driven Design (DDD) to structure our microservices. Each microservice is a separate project and has its own database.

## Project Structure
We use mono-repo to manage the microservices and micro-frontends. The project structure is as follows:

```
.
├── apps
│   ├── admin
│   ├── download-app
│   ├── gateway
│   ├── notification
│   ├── suggestion
│   ├── wallet
│   └── web-admin-portal
├── docs
│   └── api
├── infra
│   ├── databases
│   └── fluentd
├── packages
│   ├── react-auth
│   └── ui
├── research
│   ├── kafka-go
│   ├── topics-subscriber
│   └── web
├── scripts
└── toolings
    ├── eslint-config
    ├── github-actions
    ├── prettier
    ├── tailwind
    └── tsconfig

29 directories
```
# Directory Structure

We use the following directories to manage the project:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| apps | Contains the microservices and micro-frontends |
| docs | Contains the documentation websites like API, etc. |
| infra | Contains the infrastructure code for DevOps like databases, etc. |
| packages | Contains the shared packages like react-auth, etc. |
| research | Contains the research projects like Kafka, etc. |
| scripts | Contains the scripts like deployment, etc. |
| toolings | Contains the toolings packages like eslint, prettier, etc. |

## Micro-Frontends

Currently, frontend apps are in the `/apps` directory:
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Web Admin Portal | Admin Portal for the Breeze app |
| Download App | Landing page for the Breeze app |


## Microservices

Inside the `/apps` directory, you will find the following microservices:
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Gateway | Customized API Gateway to manage the authentication and authorization like AWS API Gateway |
| Wallets | Wallet microservice allow to manage the wallets including the transactions |
|Admin | Admin microservice allow to manage the system |
|Notification | Notification service provide the real-time notification, email, and SMS |
| Suggestions | Suggestions service provide the suggestions to the users by using the machine learning |


## Database

We use the following databases:
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [MySQL](/mysql) | MySQL is used to store the data |
| [Redis](/redis) | Redis is used to store the cache data |
| [Elasticsearch](/elasticsearch) | Elasticsearch is used to store the logs and search data |


## Design Patterns
We use the following design patterns in our microservices to make them scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
I assume that you are familiar with the design patterns and I will not explain them in detail. If you are not familiar with them, you can find more information about them on the [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html) website.
