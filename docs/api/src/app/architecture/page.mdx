# Architecture

This project is using Domain Driven Micro-services Architecture. We separate the business logic into different microservices and use the event-driven architecture to communicate between the microservices. We use the [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a message broker to communicate between the microservices.


<Note>
  You can find the Event Driven Design in [Event Driven Design Section](/edd).

## Project Structure
We use mono-repo to manage the microservices and micro-frontends. The project structure is as follows:

``` {{title: 'Project Structure'}}

# Undrestanding the project structure

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|apps | Contains the microservices |
|docs | Contains the documentation realted stuffs |
|infra | Contains the infrastructure code for DevOps |
|packages | Contains the shared packages for all projects |
|research | Contains the research projects |
| scripts | Contains the bash script for end users who don't know operation stuffs |
| toolings | Contains the setup for tools like `eslint` and `prettier` |
|www | Contains the micro-frontends and modular frontend apps |

## `apps` directory
The `apps` directory contains the microservices apps. Each microservice is a separate project and has its own database.
Even each service has its own database, we don't separate the database server for each service. We use a single database server and create a separate database for each service. This is called [Database per Service](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) pattern.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| gateway | Customized API Gateway to manage the authentication and authorization like AWS API Gateway |
| admin | Admin microservice allow to manage the system |
| notification | Notification service provide the real-time notification, email, and SMS |
| suggestion | Suggestions service provide the suggestions to the users by using the machine learning |
| wallet | Wallet microservice allow to manage the wallets including the transactions |



## `www` directory

Inside the `www` directory, we put the micro-frontends and modular frontend apps. Each micro-frontend is a separate project.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Web Admin Portal | Admin Portal for the Breeze app |
| Download App | Landing page for the Breeze app |


## Database

We primaryly use the `mysql` as a database server. We use the `redis` as a cache server and `elasticsearch` as a search server.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [MySQL](/mysql) | MySQL is used to store the data |
| [Redis](/redis) | Redis is used to store the cache data |
| [Elasticsearch](/elasticsearch) | Elasticsearch is used to store the logs and search data |


## Design Patterns
We use the following design patterns in our microservices to make them scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
I assume that you are familiar with the design patterns and I will not explain them in detail. If you are not familiar with them, you can find more information about them on the [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html) website.
